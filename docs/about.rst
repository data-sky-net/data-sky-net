High-level description
----------------------


This is a command-line-provided wizard for rapid data-sky project deployment.

On running Wizard:

- Asks user some questions and creates project environment.
- Helps to describe subject domain model and machine learning tasks (read more in section :ref:`Senior typical tasks<senior_typical_tasks_ref>`)
- Builds and deploys required data-sky services and external dependencies (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redash, etc.) in Docker containers and connects them to each other.
- Initializes data-sky toolkits (see :ref:`Evaluation Tools<evaluation_tools_about_ref>` and :ref:`Toolkit CLI<toolkit_cli_about_ref>`).
- Provides tools for visualizing the work of your data science command.


See example in data-sky guides (guide developing in progress).
